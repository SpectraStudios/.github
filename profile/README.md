### 💻👾 Building ideas from pixels to bricks 🏗️🌍

Spectra is where physical placemakers and virtual worldbuilders come together to create sustainable, human-centered, and technologically progressive urbanization. Check out some of our current projects:

- [Spectra Cities](https://www.spectracities.com/) - Our flagship project aiming to build a city for 1M+ people 🏙️
- MeshMap - A Solana app for scanning, geotagging, minting, and mapping a decentralized 3D mesh of the world 🌐 (coming soon!)
- City Champ - An outdoor Augmented Reality (AR) game about urban social problems, integrated with MeshMap 😎 (coming soon!)

Are you building toward more livable cities? Yes? Okay, you rock! 🎸 If not, we can help you get started! Learn more about [how to contribute](https://www.spectracities.com/).

### 🕊️ Contributing to the cross-platform, open-source ecosystem 🚀

We design open-source tools 🔧 and assets for urban design and XR. Download some of our assets to kickstart your ideas 💡:
